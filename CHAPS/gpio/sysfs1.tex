   {Using the sysfs gpio interface for input}
Our button is tied to the 13th pin on the second out of 4 gpio banks or gpio 45.

1 x 32 + 13 = 45
   \begin{raw}
# Since gpio 45 is already exported we don't need to do it
# echo "45" > /sys/class/gpio/export
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio45/direction
in
# Read from button input
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio45/value
1
   \end{raw}
\end{frame}
